# Intro
I'm an aspiring civil engineer currently pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) degree in Civil Engineering at Malnad College of Engineering, Hassan. With a commendable CGPA of 8.5, I demonstrate strong academic performance and dedication to my field of study. 

Despite my primary focus on civil engineering, I have cultivated a keen interest in the software industry. To bridge this interest with practical skills, I have completed several certification courses in web development, which have equipped me with robust coding abilities and a solid foundation in software development.

My academic journey is marked by excellence, having achieved a remarkable 96.48% (Distinction) in my SSLC (10th grade) and an even higher 97.17% (Distinction) in my PUC (12th grade). My consistent academic achievements and diversified skill set made me a promising candidate for a career in the software industry.

I am particularly interested in projects with high social impact. If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause and would like to meet, please feel free to get in touch.
